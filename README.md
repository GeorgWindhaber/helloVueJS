## Hello VueJS

This is just a small project to get started with VueJS. I wouldn't write code like this
at work, because here I don't have to worry about maintainability.

### What this program does:

It fetches data from the SpaceX launch API (just as sample data) which get rendered in
a small preview. On a click on a preview the full data gets shown on the right side.
On click the previews get also marked as read.

It's also possible to filter the existing previews with the search bar on top. The number
input regulates how many entries get loaded from the API.
